# Project GameStat
## This is a React Native mobile application inspired on the RocketSeat online coruse Next Level Week Together: React Native.

This is a scheduling and connect gameplay application, where the user can create squads with friends on discord and schedule games to play together.
There will be a full support to Discord authentication and integration.

## Technologies:
- React-Native
- TypeScript
- Expo
- Async Storage
- Context API
- Vector Icon
- Axios
- React Native libraries
- Expo libraries
  
 ## Configuration:
  To run this project you would have to download some of the technologies utilized, like:
- Node & NPM
- Yarn
- Expo
- Visual Studio Code
    
 ## Execution:
  After all technologies are correctly donwloaded and installed, you can start the project by running:
  
  ```expo start```
  
  With the expo and metro bundler initialized, you can donwload the expo version for you phone and scan the QRCode present on the Visual Studio Terminal, or on the expo developer tools (press 'd' to open it) to run the app on your phone.
  You could also use an mobile cellphone emulator, like Android Studio, and connect it to Expo to open on the emulator. Finally, a third option would be to open the expo on your web browser through your computer.
  
## Observations:  
  ***I had some issues where the pages containing SVG images would not be loaded through expo on a web broswer, please be aware of that.***
  
  **If you are running expo on a public wifi, you have to disable the firewall on windows for it to run on your mobile phone.**
  **Using VPN can also affect the proper connection between Expo and your mobile device**
  
  *The discord server will only open if the server widget is enabled. You can only enable a server widget if you are the owner or have admin rights of the server. To do so just: Click on the server > Server setting > Click on "Widget" on left side > Click on "Enable server widget". Also make sure to set up a invite channel for the invite button to work. In case you are not an owner of the channel the invite button and open server button will be disabled on the application*
  
  ## Improvements:

    - Create custom flash
    - Fix PM/AM buttons
    - Add Sign out Modal
    - Create dark mode? ***
